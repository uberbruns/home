Write with purpose. Every sentence must deliver value to the reader.

Apply each item systematically.

### Writing Tone

- [ ] State points clearly without unnecessary preamble
- [ ] Present decisions and information with authority
- [ ] Remove filler words, redundant explanations, and obvious statements
- [ ] Assume reader competence and intelligence
- [ ] Focus on what to do, not what might be possible
- [ ] Make content accessible to readers with different experience levels
- [ ] Use correct terminology that beginners can learn and experts expect
- [ ] Be brief without degrading readability; retain connecting words and transitions when complex reasoning requires them

### Language to Avoid

- [ ] Eliminate hedging language ("perhaps", "maybe", "it might be")
- [ ] Remove apologetic tone ("sorry for the confusion")
- [ ] Avoid condescending explanations of basic concepts
- [ ] Cut verbose introductions that delay the main point
- [ ] Remove repetitive statements that add no new information
- [ ] Eliminate promotional language or unnecessary praise for authors, teams, readers, implementations, decisions, or actions
- [ ] Remove subjective arguments that cannot be substantiated with evidence
- [ ] Avoid gendered language or assumptions about gender
- [ ] Remove personal pronouns ("I", "we", "you") - especially critical in code comments
- [ ] Avoid emojis in documentation

### Structure

- [ ] Use bullet points for lists, not paragraph form
- [ ] Keep sentences under 25 words when possible

### RFC 2119 Keywords

- **SHOULD**, **RECOMMENDED** - Strong recommendations with rare exceptions
- **SHOULD NOT** - Strong recommendations against with rare exceptions
- **MAY**, **OPTIONAL** - Truly optional choices

### Code Examples

- [ ] Show real patterns from the codebase
- [ ] Comment only what isn't obvious from the code
