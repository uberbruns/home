# Writing Rules

- Every sentence and bullet point MUST have an explicit subject, verb, and object. Avoid subjectless fragments like "Drops empty tiles" — write "The system drops empty tiles" instead.
- Expand telegraphic phrases into full sentences. Replace shorthand like "Target screen: A > B > C" with prose like "The system selects the target screen from A, falling back to B, then C."
- Break compound bullet points into separate sentences when they describe distinct actions.
- Add articles ("a", "the") to noun phrases in definitions and descriptions.

# Naming Conventions

- kebab-case is the preferred casing for file and directory names
